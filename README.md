# Smart-Loan-Recovery-System
This repository contains the Smart Loan Recovery System I have made using Customer Segmentation &amp; Clustering and Explainable AI(XAI) for decision transparency.

🧠 Smart Loan Recovery System
A Machine Learning-based solution designed to predict the probability of successful loan recovery, helping financial institutions take data-driven decisions on follow-ups, risk mitigation, and collections.

🚀 Features
📈 Predicts loan recovery potential based on key features like credit history, loan amount, term, customer behavior, etc.

🤖 Trained on classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (customizable).

🧹 Includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

🧪 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

📊 Visualizations for data insights and model performance.

💡 Scalable for deployment on dashboards or APIs.
